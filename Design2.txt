---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

>> Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
>> preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course
>> text, lecture notes, and course staff.

			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

argray[] - Array holding arguments to pass in
addressray[] - Array with address of arguments
argN - Number of arguments


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

The argument passing algorithm read in each argument,
pushing it on the stack and then storing the addresses of the argument on the stack.

 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

To keep track of what argument had already been read

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

The kernel only need the executable file and the arguments,
The shell can interpret the commands instead of the kernel.


			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

fdescriptor - describe an file and number of thread that have it open

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Each file descriptor are associated within the entire OS


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Given a file descriptor, the system call handler will return the file to read or write

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

It could have many page table inspetions

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The parent process wait for it child to released the sema &childthread->dead
then check its status.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and

>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily

>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

Before the process is given access to memory, the given pointer 
is check to be vaild such as it is not pointing to kernel memory;

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

If the child finsh loading it released a lock.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

To ensure that a process gives an valid pointer before giving access

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

provide a access count to ensure file does not get deleted immediately 
if other files are still using it

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

Coud handle mapping to memory in different aeras

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
